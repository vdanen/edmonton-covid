# edmonton-covid
Python script for parsing Edmonton's COVID statistics

Pushing data from
https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#data-export
was becoming a bit too large to handle so rather than fiddling with
Google's spreadsheets to work around such a large dataset, I wrote this to
look at statistics and trends.

Ultimately this will talk to Google Sheets for the visualiztion since I
don't really want to do all the plotting in Python (maybe I'll do it
eventually).

This is Sunday-afternoon hacking stuff, mostly to keep me sharp as I don't
have the opportunity to do much work in Python lately.  Sharing in case
someone else finds it interesting.
